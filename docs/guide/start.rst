System requirements
===================

Open News is been developed on Ubuntu, and should be trivial to deploy to any *nix environment.

Essentially, the project requires an OS equipped with **Python**, **Opencv**, **Git**.


Below we give a basic, opinionated system setup for a number of OSes.

Experienced users may choose to vary from the following instructions.

**IMPORTANT: Ensure you have the minimal system requirements before moving on to install of the project.**


Ubuntu
------

**NOTE:** Use of `sudo` for any command is very dependent on your setup.

Execute the commands without it if you know you don't need it.

Update Your System::
    	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade	
		
Install::
	# required for open CV:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential
	sudo apt-get install cmake
	sudo apt-get install pkg-config
	
    	# required dependencies
	
    	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev python-dev python-numpy
    	sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper


That's all the packages we need for the system, now we need to configure the user's .profile.

Configure::

    # this goes in ~/.profile
    export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
    export WORKON_HOME="/home/{YOUR_USER}/environments"
    export PROJECT_HOME="/home/{YOUR_USER}/projects"
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    export PIP_VIRTUAL_ENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME
    export PIP_USE_MIRRORS=true
    export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://simple.crate.io/


Installing the project
======================

As long as you have met the system requirements above on your chosen OS, we're ready to install the project.


Make a virtualenv
-----------------

We are going to setup the project in a new Python virtual environment.

If you are not familiar wth virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper, see the following article:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

We are going to:

* Create a new virtual environment
* Create another directory for our project code
* Make a connection between the two
* Clone the project code into its directory


Ubuntu & Fedora
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we go::

    # Create the virtual environment
    mkvirtualenv {PROJECT_NAME}

    # Create a directory for our project code
    mkdir /home/{YOUR_USER}/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}

    # Link our project code directory to our virtual environment
    setvirtualenvproject /home/{YOUR_USER}/environments/{PROJECT_NAME} /home/{YOUR_USER}/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}

    # Move to the root of our project code directory
    cdproject

    # Clone the project
    # Important: Note the "." at the end of the git clone command.
    git clone https://github.com/kobiluria/open-news.git .

install open CV
===============

Here we go::
	
	cdproject
	cd requirements
	./opencv_latest.sh
